## Project Overview

An Excel-based dashboard exploring the world of billionaires with an added lens on wealth inequality. With interactive slicers, it highlights wealth distribution by country, industry, gender, and age etc. while uncovering how a small fraction of billionaires control a disproportionate share of global wealth.

## Insights

-	Global billionaire wealth stands at $9.85 trillion, with a total of 536 billionaires averaging $18.38B each.

-	The US alone holds nearly half of global billionaire wealth (49.66%), far ahead of China (8.55%) and India (4.91%).
-	The billionaire pool is heavily male dominated (85%), with only 15% female representation.
-	North America alone holds 53% of billionaire wealth, more than Europe and Asia combined.
-	The top 25 billionaires alone control 32% of total billionaire wealth, showing extreme concentration at the very top.
-	The average billionaire age is 67.4 years; wealth peaks among those aged 60–79.
-	The youngest billionaire is Germany’s 20-year-old Johannes von Baumbach, heir to Boehringer Ingelheim — the world’s largest privately owned pharmaceutical company — with a real-time net worth of $5.8B; the oldest is 103-year-old George Joseph of the USA, founder of Mercury General Corporation, a publicly traded insurance company, with a real-time net worth of $2.3B.

## Wealth Inequality at a Glance

While India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, it is also among the most unequal. Inequality has been rising sharply for the last three decades, with the richest capturing a huge share of the wealth created, often through crony capitalism and inheritance.

- Even though India is the 5th largest economy in the world, it is also the most populated. This demographic pressure pulls its PCI down to $2,918 — the lowest not just among the top 10 largest economies but across all 41 nations in the analysis — as wealth is divided among a vast population, lowering the average income per person.
-	India ranks higher than other top-10 largest economies like the UK, Italy, and Canada in both GDP and population, but these nations have far fewer billionaires. Despite low PCI, India has the third-highest billionaire count (26), exceeding Italy (18), Canada (14), and the UK (12).
-	The inequality becomes stark as these countries enjoy PCIs almost 15× higher than India’s due to their smaller populations and less skewed wealth distribution.
-	India’s average billionaire wealth ($18.6B) is $3B higher than China’s ($15.6B) and only $4.6B lower than the US ($23.27B), despite the US PCI being 30× higher and China’s about 5× higher. This shows that the gap in billionaire wealth is minimal compared to the vast gulf in average incomes.
-	India’s low PCI stems from both massive population size and extreme wealth concentration, where a small percentage holds a disproportionate share of resources while much of the population lives in poverty. This concentration skews the average upward, masking the reality that most people earn far less than what PCI suggests.
-	Spain, being a large economy with just 3 billionaires, has the highest average billionaire wealth at $47.23B — which is over triple Germany’s ($15.54B) and nearly double Japan’s ($25.10B) averages, even though both feature within the top 10 largest economies. 
-	Mexico follows with $32.28B per billionaire despite being far outside the global heavyweights, while Russia’s $15,248 PCI and $14.73B average billionaire wealth further highlight how extreme wealth concentration can overshadow national economic size.

The table below highlights country-wise rankings across billionaire count, average net worth, GDP, and per capita income — the foundation for deriving the inequality insights presented in this project.
